    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It burbled to my consciousness as if waking from a dream. CSS3 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes" title="CSS3 Flexbox">Flexbox</a> is a tool meant for the modern age of web design, at least as my company understands it.</p>

<p>So much of this CSS tool works the way I want a tool to work: I want to set a container element, like a div, and define <em>generally</em> how its nested elements should behave. Then, I want to, for each item, define CSS rules to describe specifically how it should act.</p>

<p>This is how front-end web developers think. We don&rsquo;t think in terms of mathematical dryness like &ldquo;margin: 5px 0 10px 0;&rdquo;. We want to say something like, &ldquo;ok all you list-items, start out pushed up against the right side of your container, and extend leftward as far as you can go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>P.S. That would be ul { display: flex; justify-content: flex-end; }</p>

<p>It strikes me that the irony is, it took a few decades in order for the W3C to define how developers and designers have been thinking this whole time. It makes me wonder if it was a matter of browser sophistication, or it took that governing body a while to figure out how best to implement it.</p>

<p>The matter of exploring how a governing body of a technology or suite of software operates ought to be the subject of another post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I take very seriously the adage that the first step towards wisdom is admitting that you do not know. I consider myself a relatively new programmer; moreover, my educational path was non-standard, and as such, there&rsquo;s a lot I do not know about programming, software, computers, and the development process. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I have yet to hear of a Theory of Introspection, i.e. a replicable system for identifying gaps in one&rsquo;s knowledge, and filling them.</p>

<p>The closest thing I have heard of, is writing. So here I am, blogging about what I know, and do not know, about programming and web development. In so doing, my hope is to write about my continuing discovery process of the things would like to learn. I&rsquo;ll be describing what I think I know, and what I still don&rsquo;t yet.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that some people will balk at the notion of admitting ignorance. It&rsquo;s not done often in our culture; the trends towards self-branding ego stroking are too strong. Moreover, am I putting my weaknesses on display for the world to ruthlessly mock? Yes possibly. But here we are.</p>

<p>And here we go.</p>

<p>Some things about which I don&rsquo;t know, but would like to know more, are as follows (in no particular order):</p>

<ol>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>iOS Development</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>JSON-RPC</li>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
<li>Macroeconomics</li>
<li>Cosmology</li>
</ol>


<p>The things I know a little bit about, but would like to get much better at, are these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drupal</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>BackboneJS</li>
<li>the DNS system</li>
</ol>


<p>These two lists could go on quite comedically, but I&rsquo;ll stop there. The next post will likely be a little bit about Git.</p>
