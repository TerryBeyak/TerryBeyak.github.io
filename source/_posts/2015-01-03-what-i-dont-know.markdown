I take very seriously the adage that the first step towards wisdom is admitting that you do not know. I consider myself a relatively new programmer; moreover, my educational path was non-standard, and as such, there's a lot I do not know about programming, software, computers, and the development process. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I have yet to hear of a Theory of Introspection, i.e. a replicable system for identifying gaps in one's knowledge, and filling them.

The closest thing I have heard of, is writing. So here I am, blogging about what I know, and do not know, about programming and web development. In so doing, my hope is to write about my continuing discovery process of the things would like to learn. I'll be describing what I think I know, and what I still don't yet.


My suspicion is that some people will balk at the notion of admitting ignorance. It's not done often in our culture; the trends towards self-branding ego stroking are too strong. Moreover, am I putting my weaknesses on display for the world to ruthlessly mock? Yes possibly. But here we are.  

And here we go.

Some things about which I don't know, but would like to know more, are as follows (in no particular order):

1. AngularJS
2. iOS Development
3. Go
5. Machine Learning
6. JSON-RPC
7. Bitcoin
8. Macroeconomics
9. Cosmology

The things I know a little bit about, but would like to get much better at, are these:

1. Drupal
2. Ruby on Rails
3. Git
4. BackboneJS
5. the DNS system

These two lists could go on quite comedically, but I'll stop there. The next post will likely be a little bit about Git.
