I have a wild theory that Neal Stephenson is getting more political in his writing, but given that he's a science fiction writer, the commentary is incredibly abstracted, and requires unpacking.

I recall 2008 being a local maximum in the state of American unreason and anti-intellectualism. The Tea Party was growing, climate change was being argued about, and public debates were held in lecture halls about the existence of God. So then Stephenson wrote Anathem, in 2008, a story partially discussing what happens to society if mathematicians, philosophers and scientists are plucked out, cloistered away. Beyond that, part of the book's premise involves the "Hylaean Theoric World", another plane of being that mathematicians seek to understand. It's important to note that there are interesting philosophical arguments to support the existence of the HTW, which by my reading could be Stephenson stating that philosophers can do Heaven better than religious people.

More recently, Seveneves, in 2014 is about two things: race, and What Is Important. These last few years have ignited a whole range of conversations about race, from Ferguson to New York, to immigration debates. One of the strong themes of the book (and I'm going to valiantly attempt to discribe this without Spoilers), is conflict, and in part, racial conflict. But by the end of the book, the reader is startled to realize how much of a painful, destructive distraction that is from What Is Important.

I was already in agreement with Stephenson on the answer to that question before I read the book, so I recognize some bias, but I've yet to hear any compelling arguments to pull me too far from this perspective: space travel, expanding humanity's reach beyond Earth, and stretching our perspective to think about projects and endeavors on longer timelines than a single human lifespan are Important. 

Finally, I'll say that these two books - Anathem, and Seveneves - are among the best books I've ever read, and they make me want to be a better person. Feel free to do what you will with such a gushing, shallow and unsophisticated review.
