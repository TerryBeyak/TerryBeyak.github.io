The prompt was to create a game based on two randomly assigned verbs -- The player must perform those two
verbs in a game, and the two verbs must relate to each other during the play.

In Somnambulist, the player is navigating through a dark maze. You must solve and unlock glyphs on the wall
in order to either provide yourself the necessary light to stay awake, as well as open doors to progress through the maze.

Brendon LeCount and I collaborated on the high level game design. I also implemented the logic for solving the grid glyph.

Built in Unity, as part of the UC Santa Cruz Games & Playable Media department, April 2019.
