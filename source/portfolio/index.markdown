<video src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/btty9mlmwe0k6m4/Dungeon%20Democracy%20Clip.mp4?dl=0" width="560" height="315" controls></video>

A dungeon-crawler type game in the style of Diablo or Path of Exile, but whose gameplay can be influenced by spectators voting for 
certain effects to occur in the game (providing the player with special arrow types, harming the boss, healing the player). Effects can be 
beneficial to the player, detrimental, or simply require a change in player strategy in order to defeat the boss.

Designed in collaboration with Christopher Hyunh and Bianka Kovacs. 

Built in Unity, specifically with an integration to the Mixer streaming platform.

The prompt was to create a game based on two randomly assigned verbs -- The player must perform those two
verbs in a game, and the two verbs must relate to each other during the play.

In Somnambulist, the player is navigating through a dark maze. You must solve and unlock glyphs on the wall
in order to either provide yourself the necessary light to stay awake, as well as open doors to progress through the maze.

Brendon LeCount and I collaborated on the high level game design. I also implemented the logic for solving the grid glyph.

Built in Unity, as part of the UC Santa Cruz Games & Playable Media department, April 2019.

that they can use to surmount obstacle cards played by a rotating Route player.
